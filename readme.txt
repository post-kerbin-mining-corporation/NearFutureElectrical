============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- B9PartSwitch (2.4.5)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Near Future Electrical before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place the reactors and parts in various other nodes

======================
INSTALLATION OF EXTRAS
======================

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the Extras folder in this archive into your KSP GameData Folder
