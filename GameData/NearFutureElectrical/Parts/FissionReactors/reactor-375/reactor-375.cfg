	description = The success of the advanced generators in the MX-L has allowed the manufacturers to refurbish old MX-1 cores and ship them again with an improved power generation section. The F.L.A.T. is the one of the most fuel efficient and reliable reactors ever built, and combines this with an extra generous loading of nuclear fuel to achieve unprecedented core lifetime.
